Planit.js
================

Planit is a javascript library, built on top of jQuery, that makes it nice and
simple add interactive hotspots (markers) to a blank container or an image.

I'm working on documenting the features added in v0.3 and provide some live
examples. I'll bring this up to v1.0 when it's cleaned up and the docs are
ready.

Contributing
----------------

To get set up locally, you'll need [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) and
[`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/) installed.

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/planitjs/planit.git
$ cd planit
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

`gulp` will watch for changes, but will stop compiling CoffeeScript files after
finding an error. Keep that log accessible or you may get tripped up.

Then, follow the typical GitHub workflow:

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/githole/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
